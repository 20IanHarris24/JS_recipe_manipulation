## Exercises in DOM manipulation.

In this exercise you will be given a already built webside with some styling included. What's special about this website is that it comes in two versions. One which is the "correct" one and one that has many "errors" in it. Your task is to correct these errors with the aid of JavaScript. All of the right answers, styling, formatting and texts can be found in the correct version of the site. So there is your reference so to speak.

Each question in the following list of questions aims at a specific error on the website, and it goes from top to bottom and left to right on the website.

The solution to all these question can be reached by using the different DOM manipulation methods and properties that you might have or might not have learned during the course. Some googling might be required. This link might help you:
